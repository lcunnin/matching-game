Animal Memory Card Game

A card game for testing your memory. Flip the card to reveal an animal and match it with its pair. Once all cards are flipped, click on restart to play a new game.

1. As someone who enjoys memory card games, I want to play an online card game so that I do not have to pick up and shuffle the cards myself.
2. As a parent, I want my kids to play a memory card game so that they can test their memory in a fun way.
3. As an animal lover, I want to play a game, which has animal pictures so that I am more interested in the game.

The app has a main component that contains the entire game. There is a section for the title, description and new game button and game board. There is an addition card component, which contians the markup for the front and back of the cards.

When a player clicks on the card, the card will flip and an animal image will be shown. Only two cards will be revealed at a time, unless they are matched. If they are matched, then the cards will remain face up. Once all cards are face up, the player can click the new game button, which will restart the game and shuffle the cards.
